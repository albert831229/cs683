Package pbkdf2 implements the key derivation function PBKDF2 as defined in RFC 2898 / PKCS #5 v2.0.

A key derivation function is useful when encrypting data based on a password or any other not-fully-random data. It uses a pseudorandom function to derive a secure encryption key based on the password.

While v2.0 of the standard defines only one pseudorandom function to use, HMAC-SHA1, the drafted v2.1 specification allows use of all five FIPS Approved Hash Functions SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 for HMAC. To choose, you can pass the `New` functions from the different SHA packages to pbkdf2.Key.
